# Predicting the success of bank telemarketing
    In this project, the data used are from the direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 till November 2010, seeking to market term deposits to new customers. For the purposes of this project we will be taking on this Portuguese Bank as our client, with the goal to build a classification model to predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not to help them maximize the profitability of their marketing campaign. We apply different ML techniques Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and choose the best model. Then we tune the model to maximize the profitability for the bank.
